### Let me tell you what it does. This tool allows you to scan the socks4 and socks5 proxy lists you get from proxy sites and isolate the working ones. 


#### Usage: First, you can take the proxy list you found and place it in the proxy.txt file, then start the script by typing python3 main.py and start distinguishing.
